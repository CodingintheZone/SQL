#In this SQL (Postgre) code, I'm querying a database that's holding Netflix data to answer questions about the data. 

#1. Join the two tables from the Netflix database showing the director, title, year released, movie information.

SELECT np.director, nti.title, nti.release_year, nti.description as "title_information"
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" np
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" nti
ON np.show_id=nti.show_id;

#2. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows) 
SELECT count(*) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';

#3. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? 
SELECT max(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#4. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order. 
SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;

#5. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star? 
SELECT Tdirector
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN  "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id=people.show_id
WHERE titles.title='Bright Star'

#6. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? 
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
GROUP BY title, release_year
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 2;
# Or "subquery"
SELECT title, release_year 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
AND release_year <= 
(SELECT MIN(release_year) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie');
